        <h3>Teo Turnaround Poses (2023)</h3>
          <p>An original piece. As someone who wants to work on creating characters and designs, I wanted to try making some turnaround poses with an character I've created!</p>

        <h3>Genesis 8: Super Smash Bros. Melee (2021)</h3>
          <p>Fan art. As someone who loves and enjoys playing Super Smash Bros. Melee, I wanted to practice making some fan art of a tournament series that hosts this game. I really enjoyed the composition and coloring I made and with how many characters from the series I was able to fit into this one piece.</p>

        <h3>The Cat Returns (2022)</h3>
          <p>Fan art. A recent movie I had seen, Studio Ghibli movies were always so full of charm and detail, so I wanted to practice drawing a character from one of their movies and practicing with backgrounds.</p>

        <h3>God of War (2021)</h3>
          <p>Fan art. A game I enjoyed, I wanted to practice drawing characters with props/giving motion and work slightly with backgrounds. As a fan of this series, I felt like this could be my opportunity to make some nice motion fanart of more realistic characters than cartoony ones.</p>

        <h3>Icon 2.0! (2021)</h3>
          <p>An original piece. I wanted to draw more of myself for my social media profile pictures. I feel really happy with the happy expression and wave I gave to myself, as I feel it presented a warm introduction to anyone viewing my profile to see what kind of art I created was in store for them.</p>
