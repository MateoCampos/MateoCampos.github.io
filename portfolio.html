      <h3>Glitch Art</h3>
      <p>Given a simple picture, I was tasked with editing it's coding and making it transcend into glitch art. I wanted to go for making a style like if the image was mimicking the screen of an old CRT.</p>

     <h3>Distraction</h3>
      <p>Using Premiere Pro, I created an original video using sounds to create a scenario of a student struggling to study. I aimed for trying to aim the viewer on focusing on the student, while seeing if the surrounding loud noises would distract them as well.</p>

      <h3>Net Art</h3>
      <p>Working with the 3JS Playground software, I created an object that would be mobile. I wanted to create a sphere that could get the viewers' attention to follow it constantly. Click <a href="netart.html">here</a> to view it!</p>

      <h3>Coding Self-Portrait</h3>
      <p>Using the Processing software, I tried to create a self-portrait of myself using coding only. Here I appear wearing my beanie.</p>

      <h3>Interactive Sketch</h3>
      <p>With the use of Processing, I created a code where the mouse would form a trail of ellipses wherever the mouse moved, and if you clicked with the mouse, the ellipses would grow. I wanted to create my own sketch canvas with this code, making the background completely black and the ellipses white so the person using the code could try and draw something of their own.</p>

     <h3>Non Narrative Video</h3>

      <h3>Evolution</h3>
      <p>Learning from our Net Art assignment, I wanted to create a slide movement of Roy from Fire Emblem go across one side to another. I chose these two images to show the evolution of how Roy can look simple, and how he can look more detailed. Click <a href="p5-blankExample/index.html">here</a> to watch Roy go from a small sprite to bigger!</p>

      <h3>Shooting Stars</h3>
      <p>Learning how to make coding and working with net art, I made an interactive site where a shooting star would appear everytime you click on the screen. I wanted to make something fun and interactive, while making the user be passionate about using the site. Click <a href="shootingstar/index.html">here</a> to make a wish!</p>

     <h3>Distraction ver. 2</h3>
      <p>Recreating the original Distraction video, I added in new videos to expand upon loud noises. I wanted to make the video more louder to see if the viewer can focus on the student struggling to get homework done, or pay more attention to what videos are revolving around the screen.</p>

     <h3>Last Minute Customer</h3>
      <p>Using Premiere Pro and my own digital artwork, I created my own animatic revolving around a scenario of customer coming in the last minute before I clock out from work.</p>
