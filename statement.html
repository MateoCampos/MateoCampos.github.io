	<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
      <p>For the longest time, I've had a passion for being an artist. I want to be someone who has mastered drawing and digital artwork, who can amaze people with the kinds of things I could create on paper or from a tablet. After practicing on paper for the longest time, I recently moved onto creating digital artwork with the use of my Wacom Intuos tablet and the drawing software FireAlpaca.
<br>
  <br>
  Making digital drawings has been a challenge for me ever since I started, especially when it comes to creating lineart for an idea I'm working on. I try to draw things that I am interested in: popular entertainment, my friends and family, etc. I try to explore these ideas such as drawing my own characters or people I've seen on a recent TV show or videogame I've been watching/playing. For the longest time drawing on paper was a smooth experience for me, and now I want to get that same feeling with drawing on a digital tablet. 
<br>
  <br>
  With my new digital art tools, I feel it's important to me to use this medium so I can make a name for myself. I want to hone my skills when it comes to drawing online and I want people to notice me for how creative and well crafted my artwork is. I want my name to mean something in the future and hopefully have many people appreciate the kinds of things I create throughout my journey as an artist.
