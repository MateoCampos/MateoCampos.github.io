	<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
	<h3> I've had a passion for drawing ever since I was a kid, but now with the use of my Wacom tablet I've been working on making digital art since 2016. I've been practicing mostly everyday to try and become a better and more experienced artist, I hope you can enjoy the recent drawings I've worked on! </h3>
