	<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
	<p>I'm Mateo, and for the longest time, I've had a passion for being an artist. When I mean I want to be an artist, I want to be someone who has mastered drawing and digital artwork, someone who can amaze people with the kinds of things I could create on paper or from a tablet. For the longest time, I've been practicing on paper for the longest time, but as of recently, starting in late 2016, I moved onto creating digital artwork with the use of my Wacom Intuos tablet and the drawing software FireAlpaca.

	Making digital drawings has been a challenge for me ever since I started, especially when it comes to creating lineart for an idea I'm working on. I try to draw things based around my life I'm interested in, popular entertainment, my friends and family, etc. I try to explore these ideas such as drawing my own characters or people I've seen on a recent TV show or videogame I've been watching/playing. For the longest time drawing on paper was a smooth experience for me, and now I want to get that same feeling with drawing on a digital tablet.
