      <h3>Glitch Art</h3>
      <p>Given a simple picture, I was tasked with editing it's coding and making it transcend into glitch art. I wanted to go for making a style like if the image was mimicking the screen of an old CRT.</p>

      <h3>Meme Mashup</h3>
      <p>For this assignment, I made a mashup of several different popular memes in our social environment. These memes I chose were ones that were collectively popular at the time, and debately still are.</p>

     <h3>Distraction</h3>
      <p>Using Premiere Pro, I created an original video using sounds to create a scenario of a student struggling to study. I aimed for trying to aim the viewer on focusing on the student, while seeing if the surrounding loud noises would distract them as well.</p>

      <h3>Net Art</h3>
      <p>Working with the 3JS Playground software, I created an object that would be mobile. I wanted to create a sphere that could get the viewers' attention to follow it constantly. Click <a href="netart.html">here</a> to view it!</p>

      <h3>Coding Self-Portrait</h3>
      <p>Using the Processing software, I tried to create a self-portrait of myself using coding only. Here I appear wearing my beanie.</p>

     <h3>Non Narrative Video</h3>
      <p>Working with Premiere Pro, I created a non-narrative video using clips of objects while playing surrounding noises around it.</p>

     <h3>Distraction ver. 2</h3>
      <p>Recreating the original Distraction video, I added in new videos to expand upon loud noises. I wanted to make the video more louder to see if the viewer can focus on the student struggling to get homework done, or pay more attention to what videos are revolving around the screen.</p>
