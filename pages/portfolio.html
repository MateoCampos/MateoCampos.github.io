      <h3>Glitch Art</h3>
      <p>Given a simple picture, I was tasked with editing it's coding and making it transcend into glitch art. I wanted to go for making a style like if the image was mimicking the screen of an old CRT.</p>

     <h3>Distraction</h3>
      <p>Using Premiere Pro, I created an original video using sounds to create a scenario of a student struggling to study. I aimed for trying to aim the viewer on focusing on the student, while seeing if the surrounding loud noises would distract them as well.</p>
