	<h1>Hello! Welcome to my website!</h1>
	<img src="img/Icon.png">

	<p>I've had a passion for drawing ever since I was a kid, but now with the use of my Wacom tablet I've been working on making digital art since 2016. I've been practicing mostly everyday to try and become a better and more experienced artist, I hope you can enjoy the recent drawings I've worked on!</p>
